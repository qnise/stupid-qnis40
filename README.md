side screw mount board

compatable with pretty much all usb-c positions
plate compatable with only 1 layout lol ( shorturl.at/wBPQ1 )

v4 is tested working and no clearance issues, v5 is not tested but should work fine (plate is positioned lower, top case has higher profile to hide switches, slightly more angle)

to assemble print out the top/bottom and get plate from jlcpcb using the gerber file, i used screws from [daiso m4-m5 12-30mm bolt,nut,washer set] to fix the top case and plate together and [PC HDD] screws to fix the bottom and top case parts

use a small 3mm thick piece of neoprene foam on top of the plate (in between the case) where the little screw legs are to prevent the plate freely moving in the case
