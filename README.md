side screw mount board

compatable with pretty much all usb-c positions
plate compatable with only 1 layout lol ( shorturl.at/wBPQ1 )

v4 is tested working and no clearance issues, v5 is not tested but should work fine

to assemble print out the top/bottom and get plate from jlcpcb using the gerber file, i used screws from [daiso m4-m5 12-30mm bolt,nut,washer set] to fix the top case and plate together and [PC HDD] screws to fix the bottom and top case parts
